# ShoeCollectionCS
A personal program to keep track of shoe collections using C# (Work in progress)

 A personal project I undertook that was inspired for my passion for shoes and my collection.
 The program keeps track of the users collection by holding the collection in a list and being able to save the collection via text tile
 
 # What I have learned on this project
  * How to make a project that can navigate from panel to panel
  * How events work in C# (Still need to learn dynamic events and event handling, just learned some basics about events)
  * How to make my project with a GUI! (Super proud of this one)
  
 # Features to work on
  * Importing a collection is not available yet
  * Need to figure out how to show current list in the removing shoe panel (trying to cirumvent doubling printList function for another panel
