# ShoeCollectionCS
A personal program to keep track of shoe collections using C# 

 A personal project I undertook that was inspired for my passion for shoes and my collection.
 The program keeps track of the users collection by holding the collection in a list and being able to save the collection via text tile
 (It finally has a GUI!!)
 
 # What I have learned on this project
  * How to make a project that can navigate from panel to panel
  * How events work in C# (Still need to learn dynamic events and event handling, just learned some basics about events)
  * How to make my project with a GUI! (Super proud of this one)
  * Not to use data mutation in the import method to add tempShoe to the list and instead create a new object within the while loop to avoid data mutation and also have the method function correctly
